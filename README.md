# OpenSSH-Server Container
This container is intended to just be a simple probably insecure OpenSSH-Server for the sake of sticking to docker standards of application separation.  

## Current Status
Incomplete but functional.

## ToDo
- Inject AuthorizedKeys
- Inject more secure sshd_config
- Disallow Password Auth
- Maybe don't run as root.
